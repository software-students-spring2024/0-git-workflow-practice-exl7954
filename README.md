#### [Here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/technology/layoffs-tech-industry.html) is a link to an article I found interesting.

I found it interesting because it talks about the recent tech layoffs that have affected many aspiring software engineers. After laying off over 260,000 workers in 2023, big tech companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have recently made smaller, targeted job cuts while focusing on efficiency and key products like AI. The mandate from tech executives has been to do more with less staff. In addition to the large tech firms trimming employees, some startups like Flexport and Bolt have made deeper cuts to try to survive. Though tech job cuts used to be rare, they have now become more commonplace and carry less stigma.
